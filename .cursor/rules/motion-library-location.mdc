# Motion library (reuse these)

This codebase already contains an **extensive motion/animation component library** (built to mirror `wearemotto.com` patterns).

- **Implementations**: `apps/web/src/motion/`
- **Comprehensive list + usage**: `apps/web/docs/MOTTO_MOTION_LIBRARY.md`

When adding animations:
- Prefer composing existing motion primitives instead of inventing new ones.
- If a new animation pattern is needed, implement it under `apps/web/src/motion/` and document it in `apps/web/docs/MOTTO_MOTION_LIBRARY.md`.
